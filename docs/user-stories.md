# Foodie AI — User stories and text-message storyboards

All stories are target behaviors, not existing deployed features. The README has the normative acceptance tests. In the examples, restaurant listings must be populated with real provider data before live use.

## US-01: Joining and onboarding
**As** a group organizer, **I want** the assistant to introduce itself once and ask for agreement before participation.

```text
Alex: Foodie AI setup
Foodie AI: I'm a food-planning assistant. When called, I process relevant new messages and may use a hosted Jev service if enabled. Is everyone comfortable with that?
Group: [explicit consent]
Foodie AI: What should this group call me? We can vote, or stick with Foodie.
Group: [vote for Chef]
Chef: Got it. What's the usual city for dining? I won't save it until confirmed.
```
**Acceptance:** allowlisted group, authorized setup, once-only intro, consent recorded, no surprise reading of earlier messages.

## US-02: On-demand activation
```text
Alex: Anybody hungry?
Sam: Yeah
[No agent reply or AI call]
Alex: Chef help us pick dinner
Chef: What area should I search? Use the group's saved city?
```
**Acceptance:** unrelated dormant traffic discarded; wake creates one session.

## US-03: Live place search
```text
Alex: Chef find Mexican food under $25 near Tempe
Chef: Searching near Tempe within the saved five-mile radius.
Chef: 1. <real place> — <real available rating and review count> — Map: <URL>
      2. <real place> — ...
      Hours: unverified where unavailable. Want to vote?
```
**Acceptance:** true provider data, zero fabricated attributes, valid map URLs, no false real-time availability assertions.

## US-04: Competing cuisines and budget
```text
Alex: Chef sushi please
Mike: Burgers for me
Sam: $15 is a hard maximum
Chef: I'll keep the $15 cap and look for a place with both options. If none fits, I'll show a choice from each cuisine for a vote.
```
**Acceptance:** store each member's preference; strict attendee budget remains enforced.

## US-05: Mid-search correction
```text
Alex: Chef find burgers in Mesa
Mike: Actually chicken instead
Sam: Five miles max
Chef: Switching to chicken within five miles of Mesa.
```
**Acceptance:** no burger shortlist produced by old version after the correction; one concise response.

## US-06: Allergy and halal requirements
```text
Mike: Chef, peanut allergy. Treat it as a requirement.
Sam: Halal for me.
Chef: I'll flag places without evidence rather than assume they're safe. Please confirm allergens and food preparation directly with a restaurant before visiting.
```
**Acceptance:** not silently relaxed by majority vote or an AI output; unverified candidates never labeled allergy-safe or halal-certified.

## US-07: Vote and finalize
```text
Alex: Chef vote
Chef: Vote on the current shortlist. Say "Chef vote 1", "Chef vote 2", or "Chef vote 3".
Mike: Chef vote 2
Sam: Chef vote 1
Mike: Chef vote 1
Chef: The current tally is 2 for option 1.
```
**Acceptance:** Mike's changed vote replaces old vote; votes reference stable shortlist version; ties resolved with one tiebreaker.

## US-08: Someone joins late
```text
Jordan: I'm joining, need vegetarian options.
Chef: I can check whether the chosen place has verified vegetarian options. Want to reopen the search if needed?
```
**Acceptance:** do not silently overturn a finalized plan; include late participant only after confirming participation.

## US-09: User deletes saved preferences
```text
Sam: Chef forget me
Chef: I've deleted your saved preferences for this group.
```
**Acceptance:** only Sam's durable preferences are removed; do not claim deletion unless DB transaction succeeded.

## US-10: Technical interruption
```text
Alex: Chef find food
[Mac sleeps; app unavailable]
[Mac wakes 20 minutes later]
Alex: Chef are you back?
Chef: I'm back. The earlier search expired. Want to start fresh?
```
**Acceptance:** no stale results or duplicate replies replayed, no fabricated knowledge of messages missed while offline.

## US-11: Personality change
```text
Alex: Chef you're too formal
Chef: Want to vote on a different style?
Mike: Funny, no emoji spam
Sam: Just straightforward
Chef: I'll put both options in a short poll.
```
**Acceptance:** group-controlled poll, ties maintain current personality; change doesn't affect other groups or policy.

## US-12: Stop immediately
```text
Alex: Chef find burgers
Sam: Chef stop
Chef: Stopped. Call me again when you're ready.
```
**Acceptance:** no delayed restaurant replies after stop and no Jev calls for unrelated dormant chat messages.
